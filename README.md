## MISC
Q. What does JCP stand for?<br>
A. Juicy Creamy Pasta. Or was it Just Common Project? Maybe an abbreviation of a name... Who knows?<br><br>
Q. This package seems... too light-weight/basic/composite. What's the intention behind this?<br>
A. This package was never meant to be public. But after some period of collecting/creating niche Dart&Flutter code,
I thought this package could help reduce boilerplate code and provide some foundation for new Flutter devs.
So yes, this is barely a "package", but rather a ~fun~ toolbox for new devs to look into.<br><br>
